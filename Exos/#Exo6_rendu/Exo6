Write a function that generates factors for a given number.

The function takes an integer on the standard input and returns a list of integers. That list contains the prime factors in numerical sequence.

Examples:
factors(1)
=> []
factors(3)
=> [3]
factors(8)
=> [2, 2, 2]
factors(9)
=> [3, 3]
factors(12)
=> [2, 2, 3]
