In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

Examples:

Support.MakeNegative(1); // return -1
Support.MakeNegative(-5); // return -5
Support.MakeNegative(0); // return 0

Notes:

The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
Zero (0) can't be negative, see examples above.
