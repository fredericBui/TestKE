For this problem you must create a program that says who ate the last cookie.
If the input is a string then "Zach" ate the cookie.
If the input is a float or an int then "Monica" ate the cookie. 
If the input is anything else "the dog" ate the cookie.
The way to return the statement is: "Who ate the last cookie? It was (name)!"

Example:
Support.WhoAteTheLastCookie("hi")
=> "Who ate the last cookie? It was Zach!"
